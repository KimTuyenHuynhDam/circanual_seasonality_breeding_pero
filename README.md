# Circannual Breeding and Methylation in *Peromyscus*

This project explores how **birth timing** (season and month) influences reproductive patterns and DNA methylation in *Peromyscus* species.

## ðŸ“‚ Repositories Overview

- **`breeding_patterns - win, sum/`**  
  Analysis of breeding data based on **birth season** (Winter vs. Summer)  
  â†’ Reproductive output patterns across decades of historical colony records.

- **`database - circannual/`**  
  Analysis of breeding data based on **birth month**  
  â†’ Circannual reproductive trends modeled over 5-year intervals.

- **`methylation/`**  
  DNA methylation modeling based on **birth season and birth month**  
  â†’ CpG-level analysis using linear models, sine/cosine transformation, and FDR correction.

## ðŸ§ª Summary of Methods

- Breeding analyses use descriptive summaries and binning by year or season.
- Methylation models compare nested linear regressions (null vs. seasonal/circannual predictors).
- Age, sex, and species are included as covariates.

## ðŸ’» Software & Key Packages
